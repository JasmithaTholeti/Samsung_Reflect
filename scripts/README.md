# Scripts Directory 

## 1. Overview

The `scripts` directory contains automation, utility, and workflow tools essential for efficient local development, environment setup, and maintenance of the Samsung Reflect monorepo. These scripts help streamline tasks like initial setup, model downloading, database backup/restore, and API testing—ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors across developer environments.

## 2. Usage Convention

* **General Usage:** Run all scripts from the **project root** directory to ensure file paths are correct.
* **Shell Scripts (.sh):** Execute using `bash` or by making them executable:
    ```bash
    bash ./scripts/<script-name>.sh
    # OR, if executable:
    ./scripts/<script-name>.sh
    ```
* **Batch Scripts (.bat – Windows):** Run directly in Command Prompt or by double-clicking in Explorer:
    ```bash
    scripts\setup.bat
    ```
* **Note:** Some scripts may require elevated permissions or have specific prerequisites (see the table below).

## 3. Scripts Reference Table

| Script Name (Path) | Purpose | Developer Usage / Example Command | Prerequisites / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `setup.sh` | Complete local development environment setup: installs Node/Python dependencies, copies `.env` file, runs `download-models.sh`, and starts core services via Docker Compose. | `bash ./scripts/setup.sh` | Requires **bash**, **Docker**, **Node.js**, **Python 3.11+**, and permission to run Docker/compose. |
| `setup.bat` | Windows version of `setup.sh`. Automates all setup steps for Windows users. | `scripts\setup.bat` | Run in Windows **Command Prompt as administrator**. Requires Docker Desktop, Node.js, Python 3.11+. |
| `download-models.sh` | Downloads all required AI models (YOLOv8, optionally Places365 & CLIP) into the `models/` directory for the ML service. | `bash ./scripts/download-models.sh` | Requires `wget` or `curl` and active internet access. |
| `backup.sh` | Creates a backup of MongoDB and Redis data volumes (for Dockerized development environments); stores backups with timestamps in a `backups/` folder. | `bash ./scripts/backup.sh` | Requires **Docker**, and the MongoDB and Redis containers must be running. |
| `restore.sh` | Restores MongoDB and Redis data volumes from a specified backup file. | `bash ./scripts/restore.sh <backup_filename.tar.gz>` | Requires **Docker**, a valid backup file, and running containers. |
| `test-api.sh` | Runs a suite of automated tests against the local API (health check, CRUD endpoints, AI connectivity, etc.). | `bash ./scripts/test-api.sh` | Requires the **backend/API** to be running at expected ports. May require `curl` and valid `.env` configuration. |

## 4. Tips for Developers

* **Permissions:** Make shell scripts executable if you prefer the `./scripts/*.sh` syntax:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./scripts/*.sh
    ```
* **Safety:** Always review the script contents (`cat ./scripts/<script-name>.sh`) before running, especially on production or with elevated privileges.
* **Troubleshooting:** For advanced debugging, check the logs or outputs generated by these scripts.

## 5. Adding New Scripts

* Place new automation or utility scripts directly in this directory.
* **Crucially:** Update this `README.md` with the script name, purpose, exact usage details, and any necessary prerequisites.
