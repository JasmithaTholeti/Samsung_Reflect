# Frontend â€“ Samsung Reflect 

## 1. Overview

The `Frontend` directory provides the user interface for **Samsung Reflect**, an **AI-powered image search and journal platform**. This React-based frontend allows users to create rich journal entries, upload and analyze images, search with natural language, visualize results, and manage preferences. It communicates with the backend API (typically served at `http://localhost:3001`) for all data and AI features.
